## 🎨 Customizing Graphics

1. **Replace placeholder images** in `assets/graphics/`
2. **Recommended sizes**:
   - Characters: 32x48 pixels
   - Platforms: Any width x 20-100 height
   - Backgrounds: 1280x720 pixels

3. **Tools**:
   - [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) - Best for pixel art
   - [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - Free alternative
   - [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) - Online editor

## 🎵 Adding Sounds

Place these files in `assets/sounds/`:
- `jump.wav` - Jump sound
- `collect_stone.wav` - Collecting stones
- `enemy_hit.wav` - Hitting enemies
- `background_music.ogg` - Background music

## 📝 Creating New Levels

1. Copy `game/levels/level1.py` to `level4.py`
2. Edit the level data:
```python
LEVEL_4 = {
    'title': 'YOUR TITLE',
    'platforms': [...],
    'stones': [...],
    'exercises': [...]
}
```
3. Add to `level_manager.py`

## 🐛 Debug Mode

```python
DEBUG = True
```

This shows:
